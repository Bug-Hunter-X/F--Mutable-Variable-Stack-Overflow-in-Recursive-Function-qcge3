This repository demonstrates a common error in F# programming involving mutable variables and recursion. The `bug.fs` file contains a recursive function that uses mutable variables `x` and `y`.  Under certain conditions, this code will cause a stack overflow exception because the function recursively calls itself without a clear base case, leading to unbounded growth of the stack. The solution (`bugSolution.fs`) shows how to use a tail-recursive approach to avoid the stack overflow.
